Feature: Launching my app using iPad idioms

#Scenario: Launching in iPad explicitly
#	When I launch the app using the ipad simulator
#	And I pause briefly for demonstration purposes
#	Then I should see a label with the text "Y2K"
#	Then I should see a label with the text "Yearning To Know"
#	Then I should see a button label with the text "Professor"
#	Then I should see a button label with the text "Student"

#Given I quit the simulator
